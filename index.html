        <h3>Meal of the Week</h3>

        This week's meal is a <em>Tuscan bean soup</em> accompanied by homemade bread.
        The soup recipe comes from my mother-in-law who is Italian-American.
        The bread recipe comes from Ken Forkish, who is from the Bay Area of California.
        <p>Start the bread the night before. You will need the following to start the dough</p>
